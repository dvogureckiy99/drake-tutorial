# Drake Tutorial

[Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) is a robotics C++ software maintained by [Robot Locomotion Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) from MIT and [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/). It is a powerful tool for robotics developers but is difficult for beginners. Here, I share my learning experiences and my personal understanding of Drake. Hopefully, Drake beginners find it useful.
