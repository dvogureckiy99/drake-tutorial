# Drake Tutorial

[Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) is a robotics C++ software maintained by the [Robot Locomotion Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) from MIT and [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/). It is a powerful tool for robotics developers but is difficult for beginners. Here, I share my learning experiences and my personal understanding of Drake. Hopefully, Drake beginners find it useful.

Drake started to release monthly in 2020 and the development moves fast. This tutorial is based on release [v0.20.0](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v0.20.0). I am slowly updating the tutorial to [v1.0.0](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.0.0), which was released in March 2022.

The Drake developer team has put up an official tutorial using its Python version, [Drake tutorials on Deepnotes](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Drake-0b3b2c53-a7ad-441b-80f8-bf8350752305/project/Tutorials-2b4fc509-aef2-417d-a40d-6071dfed9199/%2Findex.ipynb).
