# Try out PID controller

From now on, you should get your hands dirty. Try follow the steps here and start by control a object with PID controller. 

To start, we are using an easy example, a simple inverted pendulum URDF as model. The task of PID controller is to do a state feedback control and keep the pendulum at the top. You could also have your own simple example\(with 1 or 2 degree of freedom\) and try doing a position control on that.

The code in the tutorial is also available on my github, so you could also checkout my code directly if you found youself stuck somewhere.
{% endhint %}

In this tutorial, we will go through:

1. Import a pendulum URDF
2. Create the PID controller, and connect it to plant
3. Simulate and visualize
