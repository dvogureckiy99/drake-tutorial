# PID control of inverted pendulum

We use an inverted pendulum URDF as model. The task of the PID controller is to do a state feedback control and keep the pendulum at the top.

The code in the tutorial is also available on my github, so you could also checkout my code directly if you found youself stuck somewhere.
{% endhint %}

In this tutorial, we will go through:

1. Create logistic
2. Import a pendulum URDF
3. Create the PID controller, and connect it to plant
4. Simulate and visualize

### Import URDF



### Create PID controller



### Simulate and visualize

### Try with your own model

You could bring your own simple URDF/SDF \(with 1 or 2 degree of freedom\) and try doing a position control with the PID controller.
