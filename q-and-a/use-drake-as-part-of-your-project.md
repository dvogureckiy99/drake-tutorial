# Use Drake as part of your project

You find Drake useful, but it is too heavy for your project. All you need is a library to compute the kinematics and dynamics of the robot. Or you just want the optimization part. And `bazel` is not compatible with your current code base. 

Don't worry, you can still use Drake!
