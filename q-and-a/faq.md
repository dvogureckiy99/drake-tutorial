# FAQ

## Why should I use drake?

If you are a robotics control guy, drake is for you. Drake has a dedicated team working on multibody dynamics, planning and control. Drake has a whole bunch of tools that help ease the development of robot control.

## I know ROS well, do I need to try drake at all?

Yes, drake has a software stack similar to ROS, but it's more professional. It has tools to do optimization based planning, it has controller that handles robot dynamics rather than just PID. 

So if you really dig deep into robotics and use serious advanced planning and control, drake is probably a better tool.
